    "This Sequential Feature Selector adds (forward selection) or removes (backward selection) features until the desired amount of features is reached. At each stage, it produces candidate feature sets that include (forward) or exclude (backward) one feature compared to the previous stage. The candidate sets are scored by training new models on them and only the best scoring one is kept.\n",
